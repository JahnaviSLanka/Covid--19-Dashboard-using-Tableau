# Covid-19-Dashboard-using-Tableau
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome. It is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The virus is now known to have infected roughly 3.7 million people around the world and killed more than 264k of them. The virus has also spread to at least 185 countries and regions around the world in almost four months.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this visualization includes country/region, confirmed, recovered and death cases. The data that was used for all visualizations was provided by google news and was last updated on May 6th, 2020.

# Dashboard
The dashboard is divided into three segments, where one can visualize the count of cases in each country with the help of a world map, pie chart which shows the percentage of cases individually as the world as a whole and a stacked bar to compare and analyze top 10 affected countries.
